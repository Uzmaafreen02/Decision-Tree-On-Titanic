# Decision-Tree-On-Titanic
I built a machine learning model using Python and Pandas to predict Titanic passenger survival, leveraging EDA, feature engineering, and Decision Trees for accuracy. I developed a Flask-based web interface for real-time predictions and gained expertise in data preprocessing, model selection, and deployment.
